# Metamorphosis Game

- Codecool Project

## Story

We have a great idea: programming is really fun but breeding frogs and butterflies is even more fun! :)

So the decision is made, we want to start a new business line with some fancy frogs and beautiful butterflies. However we are not sure about the process, so **we need your help**. Can you create a small game where we can practice the correct metamorphosis order of these creatures?

We have some cards, each showing a stage in the process and we would like a drag-and-drop game so that we can practice.

## What I learned?

- Drag and Drop in vanilla JavaScript.
- Use HTML data attributes.
- Use CSS styling.

# Rules

- the rules of the game are as follows: the development cards of the frog and the butterfly need to be put in correct spots
